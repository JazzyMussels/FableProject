           "The clock on Little Billy's bedside table went 'BUZZZ! BUZZZ!' He sat up, still feeling a little bit sleepy.
           He walked to his window and looked out. There was snow everywhere! He thought to himself '_________'.",
 
       second:
           "He looked at the calendar Mommy made him and saw that it was Saturday. 'Hey! It's Saturday! That means no school today! Feeling very, very excited now, and not even a
           little bit sleepy, he ran downstairs. Mommy was in the kitchen, busy as a bee making breakfast. Pancakes! Pancakes were Little Billy's favorite!
           It smelled very yummy. 'Good morning Pumpkin!', Mommy said. 'It's very snowy outside! What do you want to do?'
           Little Billy began talking very fast. He was coming up with big plans, and each one sounded more fun than the last. 'That's nice, dear',
           Mommy said, but, as adults sometimes do when children are going on and on, she wasn't
           really listening. She was lost in thought, thinking about '_________'.",

           "'_________'",
 
       fourth:
           " she said aloud. Billy stopped eating and looked at Mommy. He didn't know what Mommy was talking about, but she did not seem to notice that Little Billy
           was still at the table. He decided it was better not to ask questions,
           because sometimes questions made Mommy very mad. Mommy went and poured some special Mommy juice into her cup of coffee. Little Billy thought
           coffee smelled very good when it was being made, but after Mommy put her special juice into it, he thought it smelled very yucky. It also made Mommy act very funny.
           Little Billy decided to eat his food as '_________'",
 
       fifth:

           "Little Billy was cramming pancakes into his chubby little cheeks as fast as he could. He was so excited about everything. 
           The pancakes, the snow, Saturday,
           playing all weekend long...it was just too perfect! He was so full of happy thoughts 
           that he didn't notice at first that he could not breathe.
           There were sweet syrupy pancakes clogging up his pipes! His throat could not handle the crazy amount of pancakes he was trying to put down it.
           Little Billy started to not feel very good. He could not see himself, but if he had, he would have seen that he was turning very purple. He tried to call out to
           Mommy, but the pancakes were stuck in his throat and he could not talk! Mommy did not see Billy either. She was staring out the window with a
           far away look in her eyes that grownups almost always have. She finally turned around when she heard Little Billy's body crash to the floor!
           'Little Billy,' she shouted! She rolled him over onto his Little big belly. She pounded on it and
           pounded on it, not knowing what to do. Sadly, it was just too late. The pancakes had gotten the best of Little Billy.

       sixth:
           "Little Billy took his time eating, which was a very wise thing for a small boy to do. Mommy didn't talk very much, so Billy sat quietly and tried to decide what he
           wanted to do first. He finally came up with two very clever ideas. He
           could go and find his friends, who were probably all playing in the park, OR, he could go to the place that Mommy always said he was not supposed to go:
           The abandoned Trailer Park down by the railroad tracks.",
 
       seventh:
           "Little Billy was an obedient boy. He did not want to upset Mommy, who was crying and laughing while dancing all alone in the kitchen,
           so he decided to go to the park. He grabbed his boots, and laced them up. He put on his coat,
           a scarf, some nice warm gloves, and opened the front door out into the wide world. He yelled, 'I'm going to the park! HOORAY!'",
 
       eighth:
           "Little Billy was feeling very naughty. Mommy was crying and laughing while dancing all alone in the kitchen, so without saying a word,
           he tip-toed out of the kitchen. He grabbed his boots, and laced them up. He put on his coat,
           a scarf, some nice warm gloves, and opened the front door out into the wide world. A strange gleam appeared in his eye.
           'Here I come, abandoned Trailer Park down by the railroad tracks,' he said quietly to himself, 'soon your secrets will be mine!'" ,
 
       scene_2_playground_set_up:
           "It was very cold. 'BRRRR', said Little Billy. He felt like it was taking forever to get to the park. He thought about how there would probably be a
           snowball fight. He could make a Snowman. He could lay down in the snow and make Snow Angels.
           There were so many options for having fun! Little Billy finally saw the playground up ahead and knew he was close.
           He could see lots of other children already playing. He started to run, not wanting to miss out on any more activities. Little Billy was fast,
           the fastest person in his class. He saw some of his friends having a footrace by the slide. He said 'Hello, everyone!' as they ran across the finish line.
           There was a new girl that Billy had never seen before. standing nearby. 'Who are you?,' he asked. 'I'm Becky.
           I'm the new kid in town.' Little Billy looked her up and down. She was not as tall as Billy, and he saw that one of her little legs was shorter than
           the other one. Just then, a very, very '_________' idea came to Little Billy's mind.
           Billy thought, 'I just know I can run faster than her! I will challenge her to a race, because ",
 
       playground_choice_1:
           "it will be an easy win.' Little Billy didn't even stop to consider how it would make Becky feel. '_________', he said aloud. His friend Carlos, who was standing beside Little Billy, opened his eyes wide and backed up a couple steps. This was a
           side of Little Billy he had never seen, and it was very, very scary. To Becky he said, 'I bet I'm twice as fast as you, slow-poke! Are you too chicken to race me?' She scrunched up her face like she might cry. 'Don't call me names! Even if you are
           faster than me, I bet I can beat you in a race anyway.' 'NO WAY,'' Little Billy said, 'let's do it!' He smiled a very big smile and looked at Carlos. Years later, Carlos would remember that moment and think to himself how Little Billy's smile did not quite reach his eyes.
           He told his therapist all about it." ,
 
       playground_part_1_choice_1: "The other children gathered around. Carlos said, 'Okay, I want a good clean race! First person to the big tree on the other side of the park wins. Ready, set, GO!' Little Billy took off running. He ran faster than he had ever run in his life,
           all the while cackling maniacally to himself, just like Mommy had laughed back in the kitchen over breakfast. When he was almost at the big, old tree, he looked back and saw that Becky was still by the slide. Why, she had barely moved! She was
           walking, not even running! He jumped up and down, knowing that it was impossible for him to lose. He saw his friend Juan-Pablo smoking a candy cigarette by the monkey bars. Little Billy thought, 'I have plenty of time. I'll take a break, and I will
           still win this race!' He walked over and started talking to Juan-Pablo. 'Hey, Little Billy,' Juan-Pablo said. 'Care for a candy cigarette?' Little Billy accepted and started puffing away. 'Today I read something neat', Juan-Pablo said. '_________'. Little
           Billy '_________'. I think '_________', Little Billy said to Juan Pablo. They kept talking back and forth. It was a fantastic argument on the topic, and both interlocutors had well researched opinions on the matter, given that they were only 9 and three-quarters
           years old. It went on for so long, in fact, that Little Billy didn't notice Becky walk slowly past them. When the other children let out a cheer, Little Billy looked up, horrified. He dropped his candy cigarette, mashed it in the dirt with his foot, and
           took off running. She was still walking, lifting her little leg high and sort of dragging the littler one behind her inch by inch. Little Billy thought he might still be able to beat her. He pushed himself harder than he ever had, harder than he thought a little
           boy like him could even push. He was gaining on her, and gaining. He was the eensiest-weensiest bit too late. Becky crossed the finish line just before he did. She had won the race.",

           "All of the strength Becky thought she had left her at once. She started crying as Billy finished his rant and charged at her. She started to really run this time, crying big crocodile tears. Luckily, her Mommy has just been coming to get her and
           ran up just in time to stop Little Billy from doing a very mean thing. Becky's mommy dragged Little Billy by the ear back to his own house, where she told his mommy exactly what had happened. Little Billy was put into time out for the rest
           of the weekend and had to stay in his room. He learned several valuable lessons that day. SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE. While this applied to the actual race he had lost in the park, he also sat scheming about how he would SLOWLY AND STEADILY WIN THE RACE
           of plotting his revenge against Becky. He made several very, very not nice drawings of what he planned to do. Luckily Mommy found them, and took him to see a counselor. Little Billy really benefited from those sessions and became a very sweet little boy.",
 
       playground_choice_1_end_humble_end:
           "Becky smiled brightly at Little Billy. It seemed like they had both learned something about themselves. When they grew up, they got married. Becky was the first female President, and Little Billy became a professional runner in the Olympics,
           taking home the gold in four separate games. It was all thanks to the valuable lesson: SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE. Sadly, Little Billy was later indicted on several counts of doping charges, and stripped of his medals. Becky was booted out of office after it came to light that she was
           receiving kickbacks from the oil industry and was actively preventing the green energy revolution, while simultaneously opening up channels for the Russians to interfere in domestic politics." ,
 
       playground_choice_2:
           "that way I can let her win!' It's probably very hard to make friends when you are in a brand new town and don't know anybody. If she wins the race and everyone likes her, it will make her feel like she's already
           friends with us! It will be a very nice thing to do.' Little Billy thought back to a couple of weeks ago when Daddy was watching the television. It was before he went out for Milk and Cigarettes. Daddy had poured some of Mommy's special juice into
           a very, very big cup, then sat down to watch a television program called 'The News'. Little Billy thought it was a very boring show, because there were no cartoons. Daddy said there was a cartoon character they talked about all the time on
           The News, and that the cartoon character was the boss of the whole country. That made Daddy laugh a lot. Little Billy did not understand, and walked away. Daddy yelled something about 'Virtue Signaling' at the television. Little Billy asked
           Mommy what that was. Mommy looked embarrassed about Daddy and said, 'Oh, nothing, Pumpkin, it's just when, like, a little boy does something really nice for a little girl, because he really means it.' Little Billy liked that, so he decided he would
           do Virtue Signaling for Becky now.",

           "The other children gathered around. Carlos said, 'Okay, I want a good clean race! First person to the big tree on the other side of the park wins. Ready, set, GO!' Little Billy started running. He ran
           slower than he had ever run in his life,
           all the while cackling smiling to himself, knowing that both he and Becky were going to feel really good after this. When they were halfway to the tree, he looked back and saw that Becky was still by the slide. Why, she had barely moved! She was
           walking, not even running! He stopped and pretended to be very out of breath, knowing that it was going to be hard for him to lose. He saw his friend Juan-Pablo smoking a candy cigarette by the monkey bars. Little Billy thought,
           'I'll pretend like I need a break!' He walked over and started talking to Juan-Pablo. 'Hey, Little Billy,' Juan-Pablo said. 'Today I read something neat', Juan-Pablo said. '_________'. Little Billy agreed fully with Juan-Pablo, but didn't
           have enough time to engage in the finer points of the topic. Becky was ahead of him now. She was still walking, lifting her little leg high and sort of dragging the littler one behind her inch by inch. Little Billy thought he should put on a good show.
           He started running again at a slow pace. He was gaining on her, and gaining. He timed it just right. Becky crossed the finish line just before he did. She had won the race.",
 
       playground_choice_2_end:
           "With a new found sense of strength she did not know she possessed, Becky said, '_________'. The rest of the group crowded around, patting Becky on the shoulder and saying how great she was. It really helped
           her self esteem a lot. She became really popular at school, but the other kids started being mean to Billy because he had lost the race. Billy didn't understand. He had just wanted to be nice. The other children saw his action as weakness
           and pounced. Becky was Little Billy's only friend all through middle school and high school. He fell in love with her, but didn't tell her until it was time for the 8th grade dance. She said she loved him too, but only as a friend. That made Billy very sad,
           and also very angry. He started to hate women for awhile. He went onto a subreddit called The Red Pill, and got really into The Men's Rights Movement for a little while. Luckily in high school he started hanging out with weird art and theatre kids,
           and he got over the Red Pill stuff because it's a really dumb and flawed ideology. One night senior year, Becky got dumped by her jerk boyfriend who was the star quarter-back for the school football team. She called Little Billy, who wasn't so Little anymore. They met up and talked, and
           ended up making out for a little bit. They ended up dating after that, and got married. Little Billy thought back to that fateful day when he threw the race against Becky. Even though it had caused a lot of hardship for him, he realized that it had paid
           off in the end. In that moment, Little Billy knew:  SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE. Things were cool for awhile, but monogamy is an artificial constraint imposed upon the masses by overly-religious zealots and they ended up splitting up halfway
           through college. They were both pretty mature about it, and are still friends who occasionally hook up when they are drunk if they aren't actively dating someone.",
 
       scene_2_trailer_park_set_up:
           "Knowing that he would be punished if Mommy found out, he snuck down an alleyway and headed uptown to the 'bad neighborhood.' 'What Mommy doesn't know won't hurt her,' Little Billy said, with a flutter in his tummy. '_________'.
           As he tip-toed over the broken glass and trash, across the railroad tracks, he saw the Abandoned Trailer Park up ahead. Two strangers were walking in different directions in front of him. One of them had very nice hair, and a very clean
           suit. His shoes and his tie were in perfect order, and he carried a briefcase. The second man was very skinny, and his hair was falling out everytime he pulled at it. He was very old, and he had a shirt that was greasy and very dirty. Billy
           was a very good reader for his age, and sounded out the words on the shirt. 'VI. ET. NAM. VET. ER. AN.' This man did not have a tie, or a briefcase, or shoes. He was shivering a lot, and kept yelling things that Little Billy could not understand.
           As the two men passed each other, Little Billy heard the one wearing shoes say 'Nothing but Crackheads up here, who would want to buy property in this neighborhood? Sheesh.' The man who was shouting and wearing the 'VIETNAM VETERAN' shirt wandered into the
           Abandoned Trailer Park. The other man did not even look at Little Billy as he walked past. Little Billy was suddenly afraid. He did not know what a 'Crackhead' was, but he guessed the man who went into the Abandoned Trailer Park might be one. The way
           Little Billy saw it, he had two options. He could either stick to the plan and go ask the man wearing the 'VIETNAM VETERAN' shirt what a 'Crackhead' was, or he could head back and meet his friends in the park." ,
 
       trailer_park_part_1:
           "'I'm going in!' Little Billy shouted, sounding more brave than he really felt. '_________'. He stood on an old milk crate and looked through a window of broken glass into the decayed remains of someone's former home. He picked up a broken bottle and
           smashed it on the concrete. It felt good, so he picked up one more and threw it through a window. It shattered quickly. That scared him a little, but also excited him, so he picked up a third bottle. '_________'. This one still had liquid in it. He smelled it. 'EWWWW',
           he said. 'It smells like sour bread!' He took a sip of it, but spat it out. 'YUCKY!' From the shadows, he heard a scary, dark laugh that became a heavy cough. It was the man who didn't have shoes. The chaos he had caused with the bottles was making
           Little Billy feel very brave. He asked the man, 'Do you have a crack on your head? What's a Vietnam?' In a brief moment of coherence, the man said '_________'. Little Billy didn't know what to say, so he just laughed. The man
           looked at him and went 'BARK BARK' like a dog. He dropped down on all fours and started chasing Little Billy, also like a dog. Little Billy had no way of knowing this, but the man had not had any crack in several hours, and he was
           starting to suffer from something called 'Cocaine Psychosis'. Little Billy was very, very scared. He was so scared that he peed in his own jeans. He took off running. The crackhead was '_________' fast.",
 
       trailer_park_fast_end_1:
           "He caught Little Billy in less than ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE seconds. Billy's face hit the ground, hard. He passed out. The crackhead rifled through Little Billy's pockets and found a five dollar bill that Billy had stolen from his Mommy's
           purse that morning. Little Billy was crying, 'BOO HOO HOO!' The Crackhead was laughing 'HA HA HA'. The Crackhead had been waiting all day as patiently as his addled body and brain would let him, and he finally had enough money for his fix.
           He didn't look back at Little Billy, but he called out, '_________' He left to find his dealer. Little Billy sat crying on the ground with a bloody nose. Billy decided right then and there that he would always listen to his
           Mommy when she told him things, because she probably just wanted to keep him safe. The Crackhead learned two even more valuable lessons: children make easy targets, and SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE CRACK.
           Little Billy's Daddy never did come back from getting Milk and Cigarettes. Mommy and Little Billy had to move to the bad neighborhood by the railroad tracks, where many of Little Billy's friends grew up to be crackheads. Little
           Billy always remembered what had happened to him and stayed far far away from drugs because of it. He got out of the bad neighborhood and got filthy rich in the logging industry. HIs actions helped lead directly to the end of The Amazon Rainforest." ,

           "Little Billy, on the other hand, was the fastest boy in his class. 'You'll never catch me he shouted, '_________'. He was trying to reach the entrance so he could escape, but the Crackhead was boxing him in. Little Billy knew that
           his only chance of escape was a slow, long campaign. He reasoned that he had much higher stamina than the mean, mean crackhead. He pulled off several successful jukes, always moving. Eventually the crackhead got very, very tired. 'YAWN', he said,
           and fell to the ground in a dead faint. Billy towered over him, saying '_________'. He left the trailer park, dwelling on a valuable life lesson: SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE. That lesson stayed with him over the years as he started a
           disinformation campaign to assist with the destabilization of Western Democracy at the behest of Vladimir Putin. He was eventually compromised and disposed of by his own handlers, only days before the glorious reunification of the Soviet Empire."
